# Permission Management

To effectively manage your organisation on the Smart Maintenance Platform, we have role based 
permission control.

## Roles

We have defined three roles for your team:

- Manager
- Senior (Service Engineer)
- Junior (Service Engineer)

In `Settings` > `Users` you see a full list of your team members. Here, you can change everybody's 
role. Obviously, you need the right permissions to be able to do so :) 

## Updating Permissions

Under `Settings` > `Permissions`, you find a list of actions that require permission. The permissions
are all given for the roles described above. Feel free to change them to your organisations need!****
