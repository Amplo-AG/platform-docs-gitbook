# Introduction

**Amplo** is a Smart Maintenance Platform where Service Engineers can effectively turn their own machine's sensor and log data into machine learning services such as Automated Diagnostics, Predictive Maintenance, Anomaly Detection and Condition Monitoring.
With Amplo, you can develop state-of-the-art machine learning without any code.
Amplo connects directly to your data storages and ticket systems, for
minimal setup (& labelling) effort and maximal integration. Using our in-house
developed [Automated Machine Learning Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning),
you have a powerful, scalable and robust MLOps framework at your disposal.
