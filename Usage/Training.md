# Training Models

At Amplo, we developed a state-of-the-art [AutoML Pipeline](https://github.com/Amplo-GmbH/AutoML), specifically designed for time series problems. The power of this Machine Learning is fully integrated into the Smart Maintenance Platform and available to you with just a few clicks.

### Starting a Training

To start a training, click `Training` in the menu and click on the `Start Training` button. Simply select the model you want to train and press start. Our AutoML pipeline takes approximately 24 hours to complete the full optimization on our compute cluster. Once it's finished, the model is automatically deployed if certain accuracy metrics are exceeded.

### When to start a training

Regular training of the models is recommended, specifically after updating your training data. It is therefore important to continuously monitor and improve your training data. The platform has a [built-in monitoring solution](Monitoring.md), to help you identify performance issues quickly.
